# Recursive Prime Number

This repository contains a Java program that uses recursion to determine whether a given number is prime or not. The program prompts the user to enter a number, and then recursively checks for factors of the number. If no factors other than 1 and the number itself are found, it is considered a prime number. The code is refactored and well-commented, providing clarity and understanding of the prime number checking algorithm. It serves as a useful reference for implementing recursive prime number checks in Java.
